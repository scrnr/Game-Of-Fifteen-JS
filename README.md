# Game of Fifteen In JavaScript

The Game of Fifteen (also called 15 Puzzle, Boss Puzzle and many others) is a *sliding* *puzzle* having 15 square tiles numbered 1â€“15 in a frame that is 4 tile positions high and 4 positions wide (for a total of 16 positions), leaving one unoccupied position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.

Here you can choose 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6 and a little more difficult 7x7 and extreme 8x8 ðŸ”¥ fields.

## Rules

* The goal of the game is to rearrange the numbers on the board so that they are in order, with the empty slot in the bottom right corner.
* To move a number, click on any slot in the same row or column as the empty slot. The number will move into the empty slot, and the empty slot will move into the slot that was clicked.
* The game is won when all the numbers are in order, and the empty slot is in the bottom right corner
